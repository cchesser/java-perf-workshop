## Java Performance Workshop
A tutorial workshop that will dive in understanding "what's going on in your JVM".

This workshop has the following components:

* [Part 1](part_1/README.md): Basics with OS, processes, and thread
* [Part 2](part_2/README.md): Java Mission Control and Flight Recorder
* [Part 3](part_3/README.md): Advanced Flight Recorder
* [Part 4](part_4/README.md): Java Heap Analysis
* [Part 5](part_5/README.md): Garbage Collections

This workshop is utilizing a basic web service that is included, which isn't exactly optimal
in how it performs. The goal is to use this service as an interactive example and identify
its poor performing elements. To learn more about this web service that is included, see
the following notes.

### Service

The web service is a [simple dropwizard server](http://www.dropwizard.io/), which has a single API to search for talks
from [kcdc.info](http://www.kcdc.info/), and returns results about these talks.


#### Running

Assemble the service:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Start the workshop service:

```bash
java -jar java-perf-workshop-server/target/java-perf-workshop-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server server.yml
```

#### Mocking Service Dependency

To simulate responses of kcdc.info (as the service may change over time), we will first run a mock 
instance of this service using [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/). Go ahead and start another terminal
session where we will run another service to mock a remote dependency of the workshop service. Navigate
to the same directory where you cloned this repository, then execute the following commands:

```bash
mvn dependency:copy -Dartifact=com.github.tomakehurst:wiremock-standalone:2.5.1 -Dmdep.stripVersion=true -DoutputDirectory=.
```

Run the mock service, which will provide the essential end-points to support the service we will be
testing:

```bash
java -jar wiremock-standalone.jar --port 9090 --root-dir java-perf-workshop-server/src/test/resources
```

Alternatively, you can run the `mockservice.sh` script which will do both commands, ie: `sh mockservice.sh`

#### Configuration

Example configuration of service:

```
server:
  applicationConnectors:
    - type: http
      port: 80
  adminConnectors:
    - type: http
      port: 8071
  requestLog:
    timeZone: UTC
    appenders:
      - type: file
        currentLogFilename: /var/log/java-perf-workshop-server-access.log
        threshold: ALL
        archive: true
        archivedLogFilenamePattern: /var/log/java-perf-workshop-server-access.%d.log.gz
        archivedFileCount: 5
logging:
  level: INFO
  appenders:
    - type: file
      currentLogFilename: /var/log/java-perf-workshop-server.log
      threshold: ALL
      archive: true
      archivedLogFilenamePattern: /var/log/java-perf-workshop-server-%d.log
      archivedFileCount: 5
      timeZone: UTC
```

#### Testing

The service will return back results from the KCDC website on sessions that are available which contain 
a substring in their title, abstract, or tags. Example:

[http://localhost:8080/search?q=clojure](http://localhost:8080/search?q=clojure)

Example results:

```json
{
  "results" : [ {
    "title" : "Concurrency Options on the JVM",
    "presenter" : "Jessica Kerr"
  }, {
    "title" : "Fast, Parallel, or Reliable: Pick 3, a tour of Elixir",
    "presenter" : "Jordan Day"
  } ]
}
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you get a `500` error message when trying to test the service, verify that the wiremock server is running.
```
{
  "code" : 500,
  "message" : "There was an error processing your request. It has been logged (ID d8998189f8d4ee8c)."
}
```
