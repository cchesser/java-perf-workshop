    Find the memory cost of events in our application.

The memory page shows us the overall memory usage and garbage collection events for our recording. 

![](/jmc/memory_page.png)

The __Class Table__ lets us view the total memory allocation dedicated to particular instances of that class. Selecting a particular class will allow us to view what code paths are responsible for creating those objects.

We can also filter this view to a particular range in time, for example a range where we went from low to high heap usage:

![](/jmc/memory_heap_rise.png)

We can then use this filtered view and drill down through the stack trace to find methods of interest:

Narrow down through some periods of time where our heap rose quickly and then was collected. Look at the memory reclaimed after each collection. 

### <i class="fas fa-question"></i> Follow Ups

* What are the most commonly allocated classes? Where do they come from?
* Are there any classes we own that are also high on the allocation list?
* Expand the memory usage chart and only chart the Used Heap, do you notice a pattern?
  * What do you think caused the flat line at the end of the chart?
