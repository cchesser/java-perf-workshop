In this section we'll dive into the Exceptions page and find out what information we can learn from it. Start by selecting the __Exceptions__ page from the Outline.

This page offers the following sections:

* Overview: You can get Exceptions by Class and Count
* Message: View the detail messages for all exceptions and errors.
* Timeline/Event Log: View when a particular exception was thrown.
* StackTrace: Identify where the exception was thrown from.

You can select an exception from the table to filter the information to that particular exception. You could also filter by a particular exception message.
