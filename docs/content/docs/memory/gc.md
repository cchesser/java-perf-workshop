description: Analyzing garbage collections of the JVM
---

A key piece to understanding what is happening in terms of GC cycles within your service, 
is enabling GC logs. In this section, we are going to do some analysis on the JVM in regards to it's garbage collection (GC)
cycles.

## GC JVM Options

Here is a set of JVM options you can enable on your service and how to interpret those logs.

* `-XX:+PrintGCDetails`: Includes more details within your GC log
* `-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps`: Have a readable date/time string to correlate events in your log. Without
this option, your GC log will have elapsed time since the JVM was started. This format (which is reported)
in seconds (with millisecond precision), is not easy for someone to quickly correlate when this event was 
logged (as you have to infer the time based on when the JVM was started).
* `-Xloggc`: Specifies the log file for the garbage collection logs (otherwise will go to stdout). 
ðŸ’¡ Note: `-verbose:gc` is NOT necessary when you set `Xloggc` (it is implied).
* `-XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation`: Support rotating your GC log file (you don't want to let this get too
big).
* `-XX:GCLogFileSize`: Size of the file for rotation (ex. `10M`).
* `-XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles`: Number of GC log files to maintain (ex. `3`). ðŸ’¡ Note: if you are monitoring
your log file with another solution (like [splunk](http://www.splunk.com/) or 
[logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash)), you typically don't need to be keeping an inventory of 
rolled files around, unless you are concerned about log forwarding failing and want to ensure a given amount 
is still capable of being captured from a host.

## GC Log formats

With different garbage collectors in the JVM, you will get slightly different GC log formats.

## Type of Collections

A simple rule to watch for on your logs is the prefix of either:

```
[GC ...      <- Minor GC cycle (young gen)
[Full GC ... <- Full GC cycle
```

(:exclamation:) Explicit GCs can also be identified, which is when something is invoking the `System.gc()` API. Note, this is not good thing, as
something is forcing a GC cycle to occur, rather than letting the JVM trigger this on its own (what should naturally occur).

```
2015-09-30T12:23:44.425+0600: 195.699: [GC (System.gc()) [PSYoungGen: 39223K->3562K(76288K)] 49685K->14032K(190464K), 0.0047880 secs] [Times: user=0.02 sys=0.00, real=0.01 secs]
2015-09-30T12:23:44.430+0600: 195.704: [Full GC (System.gc()) [PSYoungGen: 3562K->0K(76288K)] [ParOldGen: 10469K->9174K(114176K)] 14032K->9174K(190464K), [Metaspace: 25137K->25137K(1071104K)], 0.0724521 secs] [Times: user=0.38 sys=0.01, real=0.07 secs]
```

It is generally recommended to use the `-XX:+DisableExplicitGC` JVM option to disable forceful GC events. This will allow
the JVM to still have garbage collections, but it disables them from being triggered explicitly. The description of this option:

> By default calls to System.gc() are enabled (-XX:-DisableExplicitGC). Use -XX:+DisableExplicitGC to disable calls to System.gc(). Note that the JVM still performs garbage collection when necessary.

## Gathering GC Logs

### Enabling logs

With our service, let's go ahead and start it up with GC logging enabled:

```bash
# Navigate to the root directory of this project
java -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -Xloggc:gc.log -XX:GCLogFileSize=5M -XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=2 \
 -jar java-perf-workshop-server/target/java-perf-workshop-server-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server server.yml 
```

### Parsing the log

For parsing the logs, we are just going to show a simple approach using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to parse the
`gc.log` that we created. To do this, we will use the `stringr` package.

```r
# Including stringr package for regex
library(stringr)

# Navigating to where the project is at on my filesystem
setwd("~/java-perf-workshop")

# Read the GC log file in
gc <- readLines("gc.log")

# Regex the matches
matches <- str_match(gc, "(\\d+)K->(\\d+)K\\((\\d+)K\\),\\s(\\d+.\\d+)\\ssecs.*\\[Times\\: user=(\\d+.\\d+) sys=(\\d+.\\d+), real=(\\d+.\\d+) secs")

# Look at what matches, now we want to filter out the NA
matches

# Filter content out and convert to a data frame
gc.df <- data.frame(na.omit(matches[,-1]), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Add a column header to describe fields
colnames(gc.df) <- c("HeapUsedBeforeGC_KB","HeapUsedAfterGC_KB", "HeapCapacity_KB", "GCPauseTime_Sec", "GCUserTime_Sec", "GCSysTime_Sec", "GCRealTime_Sec")

# List out the contents of the data frame
gc.df
```

Example output:

```
  HeapUsedBeforeGC_KB HeapUsedAfterGC_KB HeapCapacity_KB GCPauseTime_Sec GCUserTime_Sec GCSysTime_Sec GCRealTime_Sec
1               65536              12554          251392       0.0091645           0.03          0.01           0.01
2               45883              12707          316928       0.0092271           0.03          0.01           0.01
```

Reminder on the types of time being collected:

* `GCUserTime_Sec`: User space time
* `GCSysTime_Sec`: Kernel space time (operating system)
* `GCRealTime_Sec`: Complete time taken

Notice that the `GCRealTime_Sec` should closely align with the `GCPauseTime_Sec` value (just rounded up). If you notice that the
`GCUserTime_Sec` is much larger than the `GCRealTime_Sec`, you can conclude that multiple threads are executing garbage collection,
as `GCUserTime_Sec` is just the sum time of all the threads.

## External Tools

### GC Easy

There's an existing tool [GC Easy](http://gceasy.io/) which will do GC log parsing and analysis as well.
