Make sure you've gone through the [Prerequisites](/docs/prereqs)

First, we'll need to capture a heap dump:

* [Capturing a Heap Dump](/docs/memory/capturing/)

We will then go through three common tools in which we can do some analysis of a heap dump. All of
which are free. :smiley:

* [JOverflow Analysis](/docs/memory/joverflow)
* [Eclipse MAT](/docs/memory/mat)
* [VisualVM](/docs/memory/visualvm)
