[Eclipse Memory Analyzer](https://eclipse.org/mat/) is a fairly mature tool on analyzing heap dumps. It is a rich tool that includes the abilities to do OQL queries on the heap, general reporting on anti-patterns, and helpful common views (like the dominator tree). Eclipse Memory Analyzer tool is a separate install which can be a standalone install, or it can run as a plugin within Eclipse. 

## Opening Heap Dumps

After you have it installed, go to __File__ and then __Open Heap Dump...__ and specify the `hprof` file that you wish to analyze.

### Index Files

ðŸ’¡ When Eclipse Memory Analyzer loads your `hprof` file, it will create many other index files to assist in optimally analyzing and navigating through your heap dump. It may make it easier to isolate your `prof` file in its own directory prior to opening it, based on the secondary files which are created. You can always just delete these files within Eclipse Memory Analyzer by opening the __Heap Dump History__ window, right-clicking the `hprof` which was previously loaded, and selecting __Delete Index Files__. Example listing of index files which get generated by suffix:

* `.domIn.index`
* `.domOut.index`
* `.index`
* `.o2ret.index`
* `.a2s.index`
* `.idx.index`
* `.inbound.index`
* `.o2c.index`
* `.o2hprof.index`
* `.outbound.index`
* `.threads`

## Analyzing the Heap Dump

In the following section, we'll go through a couple of the views and what sort of data we can gather from them.

### Dominator Tree

A common first area to look at your heap within Eclipse Memory Analyzer is the dominator tree. From the dominator tree, you can organize by the retained heap size, and then begin drilling down the tree to see the contributors to the largest GC roots.

### Histogram

The histogram gives you a quick listing of all the top consumers by type. Typically this is going to provide context of the large consumers based on their "lower-level" types. For example, `char[]` is a common large contributor, which then will be followed by `String` which is a type that is predominately weighted by the size of the `char[]`.

From the histogram, we can drill down into particular instances of an object and see what's referencing them by right clicking on a row and selecting __List Objects__ > __with Incoming References__

![](/mat/list_objects_menu.png)

This should let us drill down into an instance and find what exactly is holding on to that specific value:

![](/mat/char_array_incoming_refs.png)

Since this view shows references by incoming link, we would read the results as:

"angularjs" is pointed to by the `[0]` index of the `tags` of a specific `ConferenceSession` instance, which is pointed to by `LocalCache`. Notice that this specific example is the inverse of what we found with the dominator tree, if we explored this table enough we would end up at a `ConferenceSessionLoader` reference.

### Thread Overview

The thread overview is a helpful view when you are looking at contributors based on the execution of code. For example, if you have a JVM which has thrown an `OutOfMemoryError`, you can tell if some type of request caused a massive spike which caused the exhaustion of memory, or if the requests may have not been abnormal, there just wasn't sufficient space to support the request.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
It may be the case that the thread that has the OutOfMemoryError in its stack is not the root cause. Consider the following example:

* We have a max heap of 128 Mb.
* A request comes in that produces a 125Mb `int[]`
* A second request comes in that produces a 5Mb `int[]`. 

The JVM would potentially throw the OutOfMemory on that second request, since there's not enough memory to allocate 5Mb, however, it might be the case that the code path for the initial request is allocating memory unnecessarily.

### OQL

Another strong feature of Eclipse Memory Analyzer is the OQL studio to execute queries to do lookup on objects in your heap.

Lookup our `ConferenceSession` class type:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM INSTANCEOF cchesser.javaperf.workshop.data.ConferenceSession
```

ðŸ’¡ To execute the query, you click on the red exclamation mark (:exclamation:). Alternatively, you can press `CTRL+Enter` on Windows or `Command+Enter` on macOS.

![MAT OQL](https://github.com/cchesser/java-perf-workshop/wiki/images/mat_oql_studio.png)

By returning the raw type back, you can expand each one to further look at the contents of the object. If you wanted to just report the object with its `title` attribute and the object's retained sized, you could do this:

```sql
SELECT c.title.toString(), c.@retainedHeapSize 
FROM INSTANCEOF cchesser.javaperf.workshop.data.ConferenceSession c 
```

Now, you could then filter this by including a `WHERE` clause, where you can filter it by
the title or the abstract:

```sql
SELECT c.title.toString(), c.@retainedHeapSize FROM INSTANCEOF cchesser.javaperf.workshop.data.ConferenceSession c 
WHERE c.title.toString() LIKE ".*(J|j)ava.*" OR c.abstract.toString() LIKE ".*(J|j)ava.*"
```

The auto-completion will also let you invoke fields and method's from Eclipse Mat's own [internal model](https://wiki.eclipse.org/MemoryAnalyzer/Reading_Data_from_Heap_Dumps#The_object_model) for the heap dump. You can view other methods available by exploring the [API Reference](http://127.0.0.1:64030/help/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.mat.ui.help%2Fdoc%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fmat%2Fsnapshot%2Fmodel%2FIObject.html)

## Useful Plugins

### Calcite MAT

The [Calcite MAT Plugin](https://github.com/vlsi/mat-calcite-plugin) adds sort, group by and join behavior (among other things) and an additional SQL query engine.

We can use this plugin to do some more advanced analysis, for example:

* Getting a distribution of the number of tags in our ConferenceSessions
```sql
select getSize(c.tags) tag_cnt, count(getSize(c.tags)) 
from "cchesser.javaperf.workshop.data.ConferenceSession" c 
group by tag_cnt 
order by tag_cnt desc
```
