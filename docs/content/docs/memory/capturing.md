description: Different ways to capture a heap dump.

You may be aware by now, there are many different ways of getting data from the JVM. Here are just a few ways to get heap dump of the JVM.

## jcmd

With `jcmd`, you have the ability to invoke the `GC.heap_dump` command. This requires that you
are running as the same OS user as the target JVM process.

```bash
jcmd <PID> GC.heap_dump my_little_heap_dump.hprof
```

**Note:** If a full path is not specified, the heap_dump will be created relative to the location from where the process was started (when generated with jcmd)

## jmap

A more traditional approach is using `jmap` and invoking the command on the target process. 

```bash
jmap -dump:format=b,file=my_little_heap_dump.hprof <PID>
```

## Core Dump

You can also use `jmap` to extract a heap dump from a core dump on the process:

```bash
sudo gdb --pid=<PID>
gcore /tmp/jvm.core
detach
quit
jmap -dump:format=b,file=my_little_heap_dump.hprof /usr/bin/java /tmp/jvm.core
```

ðŸ’¡ Capturing a heap dump from a core dump on Java 8, you may run into this issue:
[JDK-8073606](http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8073606).

### HotSpot Diagnostic MBean

You can capture a heap dump by invoking a diagnostic MBean which is included in the Oracle JDK. You can do so by opening your favorite MBean browser (ex. `jconsole`, `jmc`) and invoke
the `com.sun.management.HotSpotDiagnostic`. The arguments are:
* Filename of the heap dump that will be created. ðŸ’¡ Note, it will be created with file ownership of the hosting JVM process.
* Indicator to dump all live object (true will dump __only live__ objects)
